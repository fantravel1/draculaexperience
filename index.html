Bram Stoker likely used a description of a Transylvanian mountain pass castle as inspiration for his 1897 novel, and tourism marketers later linked Bran to Dracula. The castle itself is a stunning 14th-century fortress worth visiting for its Gothic architecture and mountain setting. For Vlad III's actual stronghold, visit Poenari Fortress — the real castle of the historical Dracula."

            <div class="faq-item__answer" role="region">
              <p>Bran Castle is Dracula's castle in myth, not history. There is no evidence that Vlad III (the historical Vlad the Impaler) ever lived at or owned Bran Castle. Bram Stoker likely used a description of a Transylvanian mountain pass castle as inspiration for his 1897 novel, and later tourism marketers linked Bran to the Dracula legend. The castle itself is a stunning 14th-century fortress worth visiting for its Gothic architecture and dramatic mountain setting. For Vlad III's actual stronghold, visit Poenari Fortress — the real castle of the historical Dracula, reachable by climbing 1,480 steps.</p>

Include Corvin Castle in Hunedoara for raw gothic power, and for the adventurous, tackle the 1,480 steps to Poenari Fortress. End with a castle stay for the ultimate atmospheric finale.</p>

            <div class="faq-item__answer" role="region">
              <p>For peak fog and gothic atmosphere, visit Transylvania in late October through February (Winter Fog Season) when morning mists blanket the Carpathian valleys. October also brings Halloween festivals and seasonal energy. The shoulder seasons of March&ndash;May and September offer atmospheric conditions with fewer crowds. Summer (June&ndash;August) provides the easiest access to remote sites like Poenari but loses much of the gothic mood. Our Dracula Seasons framework rates each period for atmospheric intensity, crowd levels, and experience availability.</p>

              <p>Every experience on DraculaExperience carries an intensity label. "Atmospheric Only" experiences focus on beauty, architecture, and mood &mdash; ideal for all ages and sensitivities. "Family Friendly" offers mild gothic fun. "Teen Appropriate" includes moderate spookiness. "Adults Only" features mature themes or intense theater. "High Fright" means genuine scare experiences and horror-intensity immersion. Each listing clearly states who it's for and who should skip it, so you never walk into more (or less) than you wanted.</p>

              <p>Gothic romance thrives in Dracula travel. Top couples experiences include candlelit castle dinners in Transylvania, staying in a converted medieval fortress with mountain views, exploring Prague's Old Town at dusk, attending a vampire ball in formal attire, and taking the 7-day Dracula Route as a honeymoon alternative. We rate atmospheric, adults-only experiences that balance dark beauty with intimacy — Dracula for lovers, not just horror fans.</p>

            <div class="faq-item__answer" role="region">
              <p>From Bucharest, the most common route to Transylvania goes north to Bra&#x219;ov (about 2.5&ndash;3 hours by car, 2.5 hours by train). Bra&#x219;ov serves as the ideal base for Bran Castle (30 minutes), with onward connections to Sighi&#x219;oara (2.5 hours) and the wider Dracula circuit. Renting a car gives the most flexibility for remote sites like Poenari Fortress. Trains run regularly on the Bucharest&ndash;Bra&#x219;ov route and are scenic through the Prahova Valley. Our itinerary pages include full transport flow details.</p>
