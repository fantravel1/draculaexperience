# DRACULAEXPERIENCE.COM — README (v1)
**Sleep with one eye open.**  
**The world’s vampire travel guide.**

DraculaExperience.com is not a horror blog.  
It is not a Romania-only tourism site.  
It is not Halloween clickbait.

DraculaExperience treats Dracula as a **global travel genre**.

Dracula is:
- castles  
- fog  
- forests  
- gothic cities  
- vampire nightlife  
- immersive theater  
- horror parks  
- film locations  
- folklore  
- luxury gothic hotels  

This README defines the **non-negotiable philosophy, scoring IP, architecture, editorial rules, design guardrails, and expansion strategy** for building the definitive vampire travel authority.

# 0) The Core Reframe (Non-Negotiable)

Dracula is not just a Romanian historical footnote.

Dracula is:
- myth  
- literature  
- cinema  
- architecture  
- seasonal ritual  
- atmosphere  
- aesthetic  

DraculaExperience positions vampire travel as:

> A curated exploration of gothic atmosphere, folklore, and immersive darkness — globally.

If it feels like “cheap horror,” it’s wrong.

If it feels cinematic, intelligent, and atmospheric, it’s right.

- the global guide to vampire-themed travel
- the definitive Transylvania authority

## DraculaExperience is NOT:
- gore content
- fetish vampire content
- exploitative folklore
- conspiracy nonsense
- tabloid myth-spam
- a haunted house coupon site

Tone must always be:
> Cinematic. Intelligent. Controlled.
